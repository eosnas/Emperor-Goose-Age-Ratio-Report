# Emperor-Goose-Age-Ratio-Report
These files provide the data, code, and figures for the production of the MBM Region 7 Emperor Goose Age Ratio report.  
The PDF produced from these files is also included.  This is a development version using 2014 data as a starting point.  

To use these files, you will need to download the data (*.csv), figures (*.jpg and *.png), and code (*.Rmd) to a directory. 
And then "knit" the .Rmd file from within Rstudio to a PDF.  You will need R packages "knitr" and "rmarkdown" and others, 
as well as a version of Latex on your machine.  See
